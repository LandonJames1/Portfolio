## Projects

### Python

#### Hotel Cancelations Predictor
* Developed a comprehensive machine learning project focused on predicting hotel reservation cancellations. First completed in depth data preprocessing and cleaning before utilizing and comparing multiple models (each with multiple hyperparameters) from; logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forest, to neural networks (both by hand and using libraries). This project aimed to provide insights into customer behavior, enabling proactive measures to minimize cancellations and optimize resource allocation.

#### Classification Models
* Developed 2 simple classification models by hand.
* The first model classifies randomly generated points.
* The second model classifies previously defined Imaged.

#### Breat Cancer Classification, Basketball Win Rate
* I used 4 seperate data sets to display my knowledge of data cleaning, combining multiple data sets, varying types of data visulization, and building an accurate logistic regression model to predict the most important features when classifying if a patient has breast cancer.
* **Section 1, 2, 3:** Data cleaning, visualization, combining datasets, and logistic regression for basketball scores.
* **Section 4:** Logistic Regression Model for breast cancer classificaition.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis
* Used 3 seperate data sets to display my ability to perform meaningful and informative EDA.

### R Studio

#### Airline Satisfaction
* I conducted marketing research analysis on a dataset of over 100,000 customer experience surveys, focusing on factors influencing overall customer satisfaction. Employing exploratory data analysis and data visualization techniques alongside logistic regression and k-means clustering, I uncovered correlations between specific amenities (such as inflight entertainment and seat comfort) and satisfaction levels. These insights offer valuable directions for enhancing airline services and improving customer experiences and loyalty.

##### Restuarant Reviews and Brand Clustering
* I analyzed a substantial dataset of restaurant reviews to uncover trends and patterns over time. Using exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling like logistic and linear regression, I identified factors influencing review helpfulness and relationships with star ratings. Additionally, I conducted text analysis for sentiment and applied clustering techniques to understand brand attributes and customer perceptions.
