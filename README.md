## Projects
#### Hotel Cancelations Predictor
* Developed a comprehensive machine learning project focused on predicting hotel reservation cancellations. First completed in depth data preprocessing and cleaning before utilizing and comparing multiple models (each with multiple hyperparameters) from; logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forest, to neural networks (both by hand and using libraries). This project aimed to provide insights into customer behavior, enabling proactive measures to minimize cancellations and optimize resource allocation.

#### Classification Models
* Developed 2 simple classification models by hand.
* The first model classifies randomly generated points.
* The second model classifies previously defined Imaged.

#### Breat Cancer Classification, Basketball Win Rate
* Used 4 seperate data sets to display my knowledge of data cleaning, combining multiple data sets, varying types of data visulization, and building an accurate logistic regression model to predict the most important features when classifying if a patient has breast cancer.
* **Section 1, 2, 3:** Data cleaning, visualization, combining datasets, and logistic regression for basketball scores.
* **Section 4:** Logistic Regression Model for breast cancer classificaition.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis
* Used 3 seperate data sets to display my ability to perform meaningful and informative EDA.
